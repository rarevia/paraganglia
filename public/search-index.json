Fibrocystic change is actually an umbrella term for many different characteristics:\nMicrocystic change Macrocystic change Apocrine metaplasia Usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH) Etc.??? (According to Dr. McLemore) none of that stuff is important. What is important is deciding on if the fibrocystic changes are proliferative or non-proliferative because proliferative fibrocystic change have a negative impact on prognosis (1.2% risk) and non-proliferative fibrocystic changes have no impact on prognosis (0% risk).\nProliferative fibrocystic change is synonymous with marked UDH?\nNon-proliferative fibrocystic change is synonymous with mild UDH?\nThe problem is that marked vs mild UDH is not particularly well defined; it\u0026rsquo;s more of a gestalt assessment.\nFibroepithelial lesions The term fibroepithelial lesion is an umbrella term that encompasses:\nFibroadenoma Phyllodes tumor A fibroepithelial lesion has 2 components:\nFibrous expansion of the stroma (this is the actual \u0026ldquo;neoplastic\u0026rdquo; component) Epithelial growth We typically think to epithelial overgrowth to be the main issue in neoplasia, which is true in many cases; however, in the case of fibroepithelial lesions, the component that is growing out of control is the stromal portion Thus, fibroepithelial lesions are biphasic tumors: (1) stromal component and (2) epithelial component. In a fibroadenoma, the stromal component (i.e., the excess collagenous stroma) and the epithelial component (i.e., the glands) are of equal volume. In a Phyllodes tumor, the stromal component is of greater volume than the epithelial component.\nPhyllodes tumors are subcategorized into 3 types:\nBenign Borderline Malignant It is practically impossible to differentiate a fibroadenoma from a benign Phyllodes tumor. You bump up the grade of a Phyllodes tumor by evaluating the following characteristics:\nCellular atypia Mitotic activity Stromal overgrowth Degree of invasiveness Columnar cell change does not fall under the \u0026ldquo;fibrocystic changes\u0026rdquo; umbrella; rather, it has its own neoplastic etiology.\nWhich of the following has a negative prognosis for risk? Proliferative fibrocystic change or non-proliferative fibrocystic change? Answer: proliferative fibrocytic change\nDCIS For cases of DCIS, we always order the following biomarkers:\nER PR We do NOT order Her2 because studies have shown that treatment with her2 drugs (e.g., trastuzmab) have no effect on DCIS? and because (for some uknown reason) all cases of DCIS stain strongly positive for Her2 and yet the staining has no correlation with outcomes?\nBiomakers are entities with both prognostic and predictive value. Prognostic means how well the patient will fare. Predictive means how well the tumor will respond to treatment.\nInvasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) For all cases of IDC, we order the following biomarkers:\nER PR Her2 Ki67 Aytpical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) vs IDC vs LCIS\nADH is \u0026lt; 2mm IDC is \u0026gt; 2mm OR the cells are so atypical that it cannot be ADH IDC has architectural features and cytologic atypia You can only tell IDC from LCIS or ILC by getting and E-cadherin IDC will be positive for E-cadherin LCIS and ILC will have loss of E-cadherin For ADH, the treatment is excisional biopsy. For LCIS, the treatment is simply surveillance - these lesions do not progress to cancer\nMale breast cancer Male breast cancer is strongly associated with a mutation in the BRCA2 gene. Men with a BRCA2 mutation have a 6-7% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, compared to a less than 0.1% risk in the general male population. Men with a BRCA1 mutation have a 1-2% lifetime risk of breast cancer.\nPractical sign out advice You should prioritize your cases using the following structure:\nOutside cases that will be reviewed at conference this week Breast pathology adheres to the following conference schedule: Monday: Tumor board Tuesday: MDC (multi-disciplinary conference) Wednesday: None Thursday: MDC Friday: MDC In breast pathology, \u0026ldquo;tumor board\u0026rdquo; is the conference wherein patients that have received treatment are discussed. These are patient with breast cancer that have undergone some form of {{ }}$\\pm${{ }} chemotherapy {{ }}$\\pm${{ }} surgery {{ }}$\\pm${{ }} radiotherapy but there cancer is still negatively impacting their health. These are typically patients wherein the clinical team is not sure of what treatment course to pursue because what they\u0026rsquo;ve already tried should have worked. These conferences are from 12:30 to 1 and are limited to 4 patients maximum. In breast pathology, \u0026ldquo;MDC\u0026rdquo; (i.e., multi-disciplinary conference) is the place where patients that have had biopsy results showing cancer (or some other disease that needs treatment) will be discussed to figure out what the treatment plan is. These conferences are limited to 6 patients maximum. Biopsies You should focus on the small biopsies on Monday and Tuesday Mastectomies, lumpectomies, excisional biopsies You should focus on these bigger cases on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday ","date":"2024-12-29","id":14,"permalink":"/pathology/ap/surg_path/breast/breast/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"normal-anatomy\"\u003eNormal anatomy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"normal-histology\"\u003eNormal histology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fibrocystic-changes\"\u003eFibrocystic changes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFibrocystic changes refer to \u003cstrong\u003efibrosis\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ecystic dilataion\u003c/strong\u003e of the ducts.

Diangosis Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made with one of the following:\nTwo fasting glucose readings 126 mg/dL Fasting glucose = measured after 8 hours of fasting Fasting glucose 100-126 prediabetes One random glucose 200 with symptoms (e.g., polyruia, polydipsia, polyphagia) Abnormal glucose tolerance teste (2-hour glucose tolerance test with 75 g glucose load) Hemoglobin A1c \u0026gt; 6.5% HbA1c \u0026gt; 6.5% diagnoses diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus Treatment Diet, exercise, and *weight loss are the best initial therpay for T2DM. Of patieth with T2DM, 25% can be controlled with exercise adn weight alone.\nThe best initial medical therapy is metformin. Metformin is particularly beneficial in obese patients, because it does not lead to added weight gain. Sulfonylurea medications lead to increased weight gain because they increase the release of insulin.\nIf a patient with T2DM cannot be adequately controlled with metformin alone, then add a second medication (not insulin). The medication with greatest efficacy and saftery is with a sulfonyurea (e.g., glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride).\nMetformin works by blocking gluconeogenesis. The main advantages of metformin are:\nNo risk of hypoglycemia Does not increase obesity Metformin is contraindicated with the following:\nRenal insufficiency: the metformin may accumulate and increase the risk of lactic acidosis Use of contrast agents for any radiologic or angiograhic procedure the contrast agents may lead to acute renal fialure and, therefore, to the accumluation of metformin. Sulfonylureas: these are glyburide, glimeperide, and glipizide. These agents work by causeing the increased release of insulin from the pancreas. Following are the adverse effects of sulfonylureas:\nHypoglycemia Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) Type 1 diabetes mellitus (juvenile onset) Type 1 diabetes alwasy result form underproduction of insulin. The pancreas is destroyed during childhood on an autoimmune/genetic basis.\nThese patients are thin and do not respond to weight loss, exercise, or oral hypoglycemic agents. Sulfonylureas do not work, because there is no functioning pancreas to increase insulin release.\nT1DM are more prone to developoing diabetic ketoacidosis because of severe insulin deficiency.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) DKA presents as an extremely ill patient with hyperventilation as comprensation for the metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate). The patient also has a \u0026ldquo;fruity\u0026rdquo; odor of the breath from acetone and possibly confusion from the hyperosmolar state.\nDiagnostic testing Best initial test: serum bicarbonate is the best way to determine the severity of illness. If the glucose level is high, this does not tell you that the patient has become acidotic. The patietn may just have hyperglycemia. A low serum bicarbonate implies an elevated anion gap, and this is the marker for severe DKA.

Young patients with valvular heart disease will have mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, or bicuspid aortic valves.\nPhysical findings Diagnostic testing Treatment Aortic stenosis Aortic regurgitation Mitral stenosis Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of mitral stenosis. Look for an immigrant patient because of the low rates of rheumatic fever in the United States. Also, look for a pregnant patient because of the large incrase in plasma volume seen in pregnancy. Special features of mitral stenosis:\nDysphagia: large left atrium pressing on the esophagus Hoarseness: pressure on the recurrent laryngeal nerve Atrial fibrillation: leading to stroke Physical exam Choose the cardiovascular exam, chest, and extremities.\nThe murmur of mitral stenosis is a diastolic rumble after an opening snap, which can be described as an \u0026ldquo;extra sound\u0026rdquo; in diastole. The S1 is louder. As the mitral stenosis worsens, the opening snap moves closer to S2. The murmur will increase in intensity with leg raising, squatting, and expiration.\nDiagnostic testing TTE is the best initial diagnostic test. TEE is more accurate. Left heart catheterization is the most accurate test. For CCS cases, also choose an EKG and a chest X-ray, which will show left atrial hypertrophy. On chest X-ray, there is staightening of the left heart border and evlevation of the left mainstem bronchus. There may also be a description of a double density in the cardiac silhouette (from left atrial enlargement).\nTreatment Diuretics are the best initial therapy. They do not alter disease progression. Balloon valvuloplasty is the most effective therapy. Pregnant women can and should be readily treated with balloon valvuloplasty. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to valvuloplasty.\nMitral regurgitation Ventral septal defect Atrial septal defect Cardiomyopathy Pericardial disease Aortic disease Peripheral artery disease Rhythm disorders Syncope ","date":"2024-12-28","id":99,"permalink":"/step3/internal/cardiology/cards/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"ischemic-heart-disease\"\u003eIschemic heart disease\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"physical-findings\"\u003ePhysical findings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"diagnostic-testing\"\u003eDiagnostic testing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"acute-coronary-syndrome\"\u003eAcute coronary syndrome\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"treatment\"\u003eTreatment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"complications-of-a-myocardial-infarction\"\u003eComplications of a myocardial infarction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"stable-angina\"\u003eStable angina\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"treatment-1\"\u003eTreatment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"lipid-management\"\u003eLipid management\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"congestive-heart-failure\"\u003eCongestive heart failure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"diagnostic-testing-1\"\u003eDiagnostic testing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"management\"\u003eManagement\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"valvular-heart-disease\"\u003eValvular heart disease\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll valvular heart disease presents with \u003cstrong\u003eshortness of breath\u003c/strong\u003e as the chief complaint.
