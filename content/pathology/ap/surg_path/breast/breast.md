## Normal anatomy
## Normal histology

## Fibrocystic changes
Fibrocystic changes refer to **fibrosis** and **cystic dilataion** of the ducts. Fibrocystic change is actually an umbrella term for many different characteristics:
- Microcystic change
- Macrocystic change
- Apocrine metaplasia
- Usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH)
- Etc.???

(According to Dr. McLemore) none of that stuff is important. What is important is deciding on if the fibrocystic changes are *proliferative* **or** *non-proliferative* because proliferative fibrocystic change have a negative impact on prognosis (1.2% risk) and non-proliferative fibrocystic changes have no impact on prognosis (0% risk).

Proliferative fibrocystic change is synonymous with marked UDH?

Non-proliferative fibrocystic change is synonymous with mild UDH?

The problem is that marked vs mild UDH is not particularly well defined; it's more of a gestalt assessment.

## Fibroepithelial lesions
The term **fibroepithelial lesion** is an umbrella term that encompasses:
- Fibroadenoma
- Phyllodes tumor
  
A *fibroepithelial* lesion has 2 components:
1. Fibrous expansion of the stroma (this is the actual "neoplastic" component)
2. Epithelial growth
   - We typically think to epithelial overgrowth to be the main issue in neoplasia, which is true in many cases; however, in the case of fibroepithelial lesions, the component that is growing out of control is the stromal portion
  
Thus, fibroepithelial lesions are **biphasic** tumors: (1) stromal component and (2) epithelial component. In a fibroadenoma, the stromal component (i.e., the excess collagenous stroma) and the epithelial component (i.e., the glands) are of equal volume. In a Phyllodes tumor, the stromal component is of greater volume than the epithelial component.

Phyllodes tumors are subcategorized into 3 types:
1. Benign
2. Borderline
3. Malignant

It is practically impossible to differentiate a fibroadenoma from a benign Phyllodes tumor. You bump up the grade of a Phyllodes tumor by evaluating the following characteristics:
1. Cellular atypia
2. Mitotic activity
3. Stromal overgrowth
4. Degree of invasiveness

**Columnar cell change** does *not* fall under the "fibrocystic changes" umbrella; rather, it has its own neoplastic etiology.

{{< callout note >}} Which of the following has a negative prognosis for risk? Proliferative fibrocystic change or non-proliferative fibrocystic change? **Answer:** proliferative fibrocytic change {{< /callout >}}

## DCIS
For cases of DCIS, we always order the following biomarkers:
- ER
- PR

We do NOT order Her2 because studies have shown that treatment with her2 drugs (e.g., trastuzmab) have no effect on DCIS? and because (for some uknown reason) all cases of DCIS stain strongly positive for Her2 and yet the staining has no correlation with outcomes?

**Biomakers** are entities with both *prognostic* and *predictive* value. Prognostic means how well the patient will fare. Predictive means how well the tumor will respond to treatment.

## Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
For all cases of IDC, we order the following biomarkers:
- ER
- PR
- Her2
- Ki67

Aytpical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) vs IDC vs LCIS
- ADH is < 2mm
- IDC is > 2mm **OR** the cells are so atypical that it cannot be ADH
  - IDC has architectural features and cytologic atypia
- You can only tell IDC from LCIS or ILC by getting and E-cadherin
  - IDC will be positive for E-cadherin
  - LCIS and ILC will have loss of E-cadherin

For ADH, the treatment is excisional biopsy.
For LCIS, the treatment is simply surveillance - these lesions do not progress to cancer

## Male breast cancer
Male breast cancer is strongly associated with a mutation in the **BRCA2** gene. Men with a BRCA2 mutation have a 6-7% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, compared to a less than 0.1% risk in the general male population. Men with a BRCA1 mutation have a 1-2% lifetime risk of breast cancer.

## Practical sign out advice
You should prioritize your cases using the following structure:
- Outside cases that will be reviewed at conference this week
  - Breast pathology adheres to the following conference schedule:
    - Monday: Tumor board
    - Tuesday: MDC (multi-disciplinary conference)
    - Wednesday: None
    - Thursday: MDC
    - Friday: MDC
  - In breast pathology, "tumor board" is the conference wherein patients that have received treatment are discussed. These are patient with breast cancer that have undergone some form of {{ <math> }}$\pm${{ </math> }} chemotherapy {{ <math> }}$\pm${{ </math> }} surgery {{ <math> }}$\pm${{ </math> }} radiotherapy but there cancer is still negatively impacting their health. These are typically patients wherein the clinical team is not sure of what treatment course to pursue because what they've already tried should have worked. These conferences are from 12:30 to 1 and are limited to 4 patients maximum.
  - In breast pathology, "MDC" (i.e., multi-disciplinary conference) is the place where patients that have had biopsy results showing cancer (or some other disease that needs treatment) will be discussed to figure out what the treatment plan is. These conferences are limited to 6 patients maximum.
- Biopsies
  - You should focus on the small biopsies on Monday and Tuesday
- Mastectomies, lumpectomies, excisional biopsies
  - You should focus on these bigger cases on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
