### Management

## Valvular heart disease
All valvular heart disease presents with **shortness of breath** as the chief complaint. Look for the phrase **"worse with exertion or exercise."** Hypertesnion, myocardial infarction, ischemia, increasing age, and rhuematic fever will be in the history but (with the exception of rheumatic heart disease) are probably too nonspecific to give you the diagnosis. Young patients with valvular heart disease will have mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, or bicuspid aortic valves.

### Physical findings

### Diagnostic testing
### Treatment

### Aortic stenosis

### Aortic regurgitation

### Mitral stenosis
**Rheumatic fever** is the most common cause of mitral stenosis. Look for an **immigrant patient** because of the low rates of rheumatic fever in the United States. Also, look for a **pregnant patient** because of the large incrase in plasma volume seen in pregnancy. Special features of mitral stenosis:
- **Dysphagia**: large left atrium pressing on the esophagus
- **Hoarseness**: pressure on the recurrent laryngeal nerve
- **Atrial fibrillation**: leading to stroke

#### Physical exam
Choose the cardiovascular exam, chest, and extremities.

The murmur of mitral stenosis is a **diastolic rumble after an opening snap**, which can be described as an "extra sound" in diastole. The S1 is louder. As the mitral stenosis worsens, the opening snap moves closer to S2. The murmur will increase in intensity with leg raising, squatting, and expiration.

#### Diagnostic testing
**TTE** is the best initial diagnostic test. **TEE** is more accurate. **Left heart catheterization is the most accurate test**. For CCS cases, also choose an **EKG** and a **chest X-ray**, which will show left atrial hypertrophy. On chest X-ray, there is **staightening of the left heart border and evlevation of the left mainstem bronchus**. There may also be a description of a double density in the cardiac silhouette (from left atrial enlargement).

#### Treatment
**Diuretics** are the best initial therapy. They do *not* alter disease progression. **Balloon valvuloplasty** is the most effective therapy. Pregnant women can and should be readily treated with balloon valvuloplasty. Pregnancy is *not* a contraindication to valvuloplasty.

### Mitral regurgitation

### Ventral septal defect

### Atrial septal defect

## Cardiomyopathy

## Pericardial disease

## Aortic disease

## Peripheral artery disease

## Rhythm disorders

## Syncope
