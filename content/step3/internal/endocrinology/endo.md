## Diabetis
### Diangosis
Diagnosis of *diabetes mellitus* is made with *one* of the following:
1. Two fasting glucose readings {{< math >}}$\geq${{< /math >}} 126 mg/dL
   - Fasting glucose = measured after 8 hours of fasting
   - Fasting glucose 100-126 {{< math >}} $\rightarrow$ {{< /math >}} prediabetes
2. One random glucose {{< math >}}$\geq${{< /math >}} 200 with symptoms (e.g., polyruia, polydipsia, polyphagia)
3. Abnormal glucose tolerance teste (2-hour glucose tolerance test with 75 g glucose load)
4. Hemoglobin A1c > 6.5%

{{< callout note >}} HbA1c > 6.5% diagnoses diabetes. {{< /callout >}}

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus
#### Treatment
**Diet**, **exercise**, and **weight loss* are the best initial therpay for T2DM. Of patieth with T2DM, 25% can be controlled with exercise adn weight alone.

The best initial medical therapy is *metformin*. Metformin is particularly beneficial in obese patients, because it does not lead to added weight gain. Sulfonylurea medications lead to increased weight gain because they increase the release of insulin.

If a patient with T2DM cannot be adequately controlled with metformin alone, then add a second medication (not insulin). The medication with greatest efficacy and saftery is with a *sulfonyurea* (e.g., glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride).

**Metformin** works by *blocking gluconeogenesis*. The main advantages of metformin are:
- No risk of hypoglycemia
- Does not increase obesity

Metformin is **contraindicated** with the following:
- **Renal insufficiency**: the metformin may accumulate and increase the risk of lactic acidosis
- **Use of contrast agents** for any radiologic or angiograhic procedure {{< math >}}$\rightarrow${{< /math >}} the contrast agents may lead to acute renal fialure and, therefore, to the accumluation of metformin.

**Sulfonylureas**: these are **glyburide**, **glimeperide**, and **glipizide**. These agents work by causeing the **increased release of insulin** from the pancreas. Following are the *adverse effects* of sulfonylureas:
- Hypoglycemia
- Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus (juvenile onset)
Type 1 diabetes alwasy result form **underproduction of insulin**. The **pancreas is destroyed** during childhood on an autoimmune/genetic basis.

These patients are thin and do *not* respond to weight loss, exercise, or oral hypoglycemic agents. Sulfonylureas do *not* work, because there is no functioning pancreas to increase insulin release.

T1DM are more prone to developoing **diabetic ketoacidosis** because of severe insulin deficiency.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
DKA presents as an extremely ill patient with **hyperventilation** as comprensation for the **metabolic acidosis** (low bicarbonate). The patient also has a **"fruity" odor of the breath** from acetone and possibly **confusion** from the hyperosmolar state.

#### Diagnostic testing
- Best initial test: **serum bicarbonate** is the best way to determine the severity of illness. If the glucose level is high, this does *not* tell you that the patient has become acidotic. The patietn may just have hyperglycemia. A **low serum bicarbonate** implies an elevated anion gap, and this is the marker for severe DKA.
