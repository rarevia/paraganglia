## General Management of an Overdose Patient
The most important step for an acute change in mental status of unclear etiology is to administer antidotes such as **naolxone**, **dextrose**, and **thiamine**. Oxygen does not make a specific difference. Gastric emptying is not as useful as a specific antidote and should only be used if it is very clear that the overdose occurred during the last hour. When you have an acute change in mental status, **hypoglycemia** is avery common cause, as is an **opiate overdose**. 

{{< callout note >}} On a CCS, give naloxone, thiamine, and dextrose and give oxygen and saline while checking the toxicology screen - all at the same time. {{< /callout >}}

*When do I answer "gastric emptying"?*
Gastric emptying is almost always the wrong answer. Gastric emptying is *only* useful in the first hour after an overdose.
- 1 hour: 50% of pills can be removed
- 1–2 hours: 15% of pills can be removed
- 2 hours: It is useless

You can *never* perform gastric emptying when caustics (acids and alkalis) have been ingested.

Ipecac can *never* be used in a patient with altered mental status because the patient will aspirate. Ipecac is *always* wrong in children.

Intubation and lavage can *rarely* be performed *if* the patient has ingested the substance within the last 1–2 hours and there is *no* response to naloxone, dextrose, and thiamine.

*When do I answer "naloxone, dextrose, and thiamine"?*
These medications are used for an acute mental status change of unclear etiology.

*When do I answer "charcoal"?*
Charcoal will *not* harm anyone. In other words, give it. Charcoal can help in most overdose cases. If you have a toxicology case and do not know what to do - give charcoal.

{{< callout note >}} **CCS Tip:** In overdose cases, do multiple things simultaneously. If there is a change in mental status from an overdose, give naloxone, thiamine, and dextrose at teh same time as checking a toxicology screen, giving oxygen, and checking routine labs {{< /callout >}}

The following is the overdose case "menu":
- **Specific antidote** if the etiology is clear
- **Toxicology screen**
- **Charcoal**
- **CBC**, **chemistry**, **urinalysis**
- **Psychiatry consultation** if the overdose is the result of a suicide attempt
- **Oxygen** for carbon monoxide poisoning or any dyspneic patient

The following table lists the specific antidotes for various kinds of poisons:

| Substance | Antidote |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Acteaminophen | N-acetyl cysteine |
| Aspirin | Bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine |
| Benzodiazepines | Do *not* give flumazenil; it may precipitate a seizure |
| Carbon monoxide | 100% oxygen |
| Digoxin | Digoxin-binding antibodies |
| Ethylene glycol | Fomepizole or ethanol |
| Methanol | Fomepizole or ethanol |
| Methemoglobinemia | Methylene blue |
| Neuroleptic malignant syndrome | Bromocriptine, dantrolene |
| Opiates | Naloxone |
| Organophosphates | Atropine, pralidoxime |
| Tricyclic antidepressants | Bicarbonate protects the heart |
